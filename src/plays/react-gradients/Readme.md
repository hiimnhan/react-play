# React Gradients

React Gradients is list of beautiful gradients which you can easily use for your application by copying the CSS/TailwindCSS code for the desired gradient. You can also copy each color that has been used in the gradient.

## Implementation Details

The implementation of the play is fairly simple.

- Firstly it consumes data _(list of gradients and its details)_ from a `json` file called `gradients.json`.
- Then it uses the `.map()` function to loop through this data and get each object _(gradient)_.
- Each object/gradient has the following properties:
  - `name` - The Name of the gradient
  - `tailwind` - The TailwindCSS code for the gradient.
  - `css` - The CSS code for the gradient.
  - `colors` - A list of colors used in the gradient.
- The properties of each gradient is passed to the separate component named `GradientComponent` in the `GradientComponent.js` file to be styled and displayed.
- In the `GradientComponent` component, you will find the following function:
  - `copyCode` - This function is used to copy the tailwind, css, color of a gradient to the clipboard. This function **takes in 2 arguments**.
    1. `codeToCopy` - The text that needs to be copied.
    2. `message` - The message to be displayed in the toast. _(If user clicked to copy the TailwindCSS code, the message argument is "TailwindCSS". Then the toast says "Copied TailwindCSS")_
  - > **Note:-** Initially, there were three different functions(`copyTailwind`, `copyCSS`, `copyColor`) to copy. Later combined these functions into one, the `copyCode` function for better practice and efficiency.
- Also in the `GradientComponent` component, you will find a `GradientCopyButton` component. This is a button component for copying the different TailwindCSS, CSS and color codes. It also displays a tooltip on hover. This tooltip is achieved by using react useState hook, `debounce` function of `lodash` to set delay on hover and onMouseEnter,onMouseLeave events to set the state of a state variable. Then the tooltip is conditionally displayed using that state variable.
- And finally, the play uses `react-hot-toast` _(a notification library for react)_ to display a message after user has copied.

### Adding a new gradient

Currently to add a new gradient, you'll have to create a new `json` object in the `gradients.json` file. To do so, please follow the below steps.

- In the `gradients.json` file, add a new gradient of choice using the following syntax:
  ```json
  {
      "name": "Name of the Gradient",
      "css": "CSS code for the gradient.",
      "tailwind": "TailwindCSS code for the gradient",
      "colors": ["A list containing all the colors used in the gradient"]
  },
  ```
  **Example**:
  ```json
  {
      "name": "Flamingo",
      "css": "linear-gradient(to right, #f472b6, #db2777)",
      "tailwind": "bg-gradient-to-r from-pink-400 to-pink-600",
      "colors": ["#f472b6", "#db2777"]
  },
  ```
- Then create a Pull Request referencing this play.
  > **Note:-** Please make sure to add all your colors in the form of HEX. Please use [this converter](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_converter.asp) if you have used any other format.

> **Also Note:-** In the future, I'm hoping to add a feature where you are able to add a gradient easily by filling a simple form directly from the play so that you don't have to go through the trouble of doing everything manually, so stay tuned for that!
