## Implementation Details

To make this basic calculator I have used React.js, I have used useReducer Hook to implement all the functionalities. I haven't used any external libraries for this project.

## Consideration

It is a Basic Calculator where one can only do Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division. So, here we can not do any other calculation except these four operations.
