# CodeNchill

- `CodeNchill` is a productivity application designed to enhance your focus hours. This app integrates a lofi-music player and a Pomodoro timer to help you stay productive.

# Tool Features

- CodeNchill , the one-stop tool to take your productivity to the next level

- It comes with a bunch of features with a seamless User Experience and an elegant design for both mobile and desktop.

- The following are the features of the tool:

  - You can easily play, pause , and shuffle your lo-fi tracks, and adjust the volume or mute the audio with just one click.

  - You can set the timer in three fixed tabs - Rest, Work and Focus , or even set a custom timer to fit your specific needs. Once you turn on the timer, you can see it in the title of your browser tab.

  - The key highlight of this tool is that it will notify you with a VOICE ALERT once the timer is over, reminding you to "rest" or "get back to work" based on your timer mode. If the timer is set for five minutes or less, it's time for rest , otherwise, it's time for get back to work mode.

  - My main focus in this tool is on enhancing user accessibility, thus we have provided several keyboard shortcut keys for your convenience.:

  ➜ Press 's' to shuffel the tracks
  ➜ Press 'Spacebar' to play/pause
  ➜ Press 'Next arrow key' for next track
  ➜ Press 'Back arroy key' for previouse track
  ➜ Press 'm' to mute/unmute
