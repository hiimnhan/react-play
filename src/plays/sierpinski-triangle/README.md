# Sierpinski Triangle ðŸ”º

An Interesting use of p5.js and along with recursion. Sierpinski Triangle is an equilateral triangle, subdivided recursively into smaller equilateral triangles.

## Play Demographic

## Implementation Details

p5.js is a JavaScript library for creative coding. It has a full set of drawing functionality.

The `SierpinskiTriangle` component is the first in all. You will see the Triangle filled with a different set of colours each time you refresh or resize the website.

- We make use of the `Sketch` component provided by the react-p5 package that lets us integrate p5 Sketches into our React App. `setup()` and `draw()` functions are passed to the component as props.

- We have a `Triangle` class and pass 3 vectors to it. Than call the `drawSierpinskiTriangle()` function.

- `drawSierpinskiTriangle()` is a recursive function that terminates when depth becomes equal to level.

- We find the mid point of the 3 vectors and create a new triangle from it.

- We have a `generateRandomColor()` utility function that generates random color to fill the triangle with.
